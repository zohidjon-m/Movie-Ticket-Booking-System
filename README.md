1. Activity: Displaying Main Menu
- Implementation: Use control statements (such as switch case) to present options to
the user.
2. Activity: Adding Movies to the Database
- Implementation: Use structures to define a movie's properties (e.g., title, genre, year, country) and dynamically allocate memory for storing multiple movie records, and use file handling to store data.
3. Activity: Displaying Available Movies
- Implementation: Utilize arrays (1D/2D) to store and display the list of available movies.
4. Activity: Searching for a Movie
- Implementation: Implement a search function using pointers to locate a movie by title
or genre.
5. Activity: Booking Tickets
- Implementation: Use arrays (1D/2D) to represent the seating arrangement, allowing
users to select seats for their desired movie and time slot.
6. Activity: Canceling Tickets
- Implementation: Modify the seating arrangement array to mark canceled seats as
available again.
7. Activity: Displaying Booked Tickets
- Implementation: Use file management techniques to save and retrieve booked tickets
information from external files.
8. Activity: Calculating Total Revenue
- Implementation: Track the cost of each ticket sold and use appropriate arithmetic
operations to calculate the total revenue earned.
9. Activity: Generating Sales Report
- Implementation: Utilize file management operations to create a report that summarizes
the total revenue earned and other relevant statistics.
10. Activity: Exiting the Program
- Implementation: Use appropriate control statements to exit gracefully from the
program.
