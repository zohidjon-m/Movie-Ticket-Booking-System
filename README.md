# Movie Ticket Management System (C Programming)

## Overview
A console-based Movie Ticket Management System developed in C.  
The system allows users to view available movies, book tickets, cancel bookings, and manage simple movie data through a text-based interface.

This project was built to practice fundamental programming concepts such as file I/O, structures, dynamic memory management, and modular programming in C.

## Key Features
- Display available movies with showtimes.
- Book tickets for selected movies.
- Cancel existing bookings.
- Update or delete movie listings (optional depending on your version).
- Simple text-based user interface.

## Technologies Used
- C Programming Language (C99 standard)
- Standard Libraries: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, `time.h`
- File Handling (Persistent data storage in `.txt` files)
